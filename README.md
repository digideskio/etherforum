# cryptoforum

An experimental / proof of concept / distributed forum built on top of Ethereum

## Contracts

I'm including a few contract templates, and I would be happy to provide a setup wizard (?).

## Requirements

Some ether and patience?

You may run it locally (devnet) as well!

## Ideas

* whisper integration
* alt clients (mobile?)
* integrate with [ethereumjs-accounts](https://github.com/SilentCicero/ethereumjs-accounts)

## Contact
