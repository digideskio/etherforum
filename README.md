# cryptoforum

An experimental / proof of concept / distributed forum built on top of Ethereum

## Contracts

I'm including a few contract templates, and I would be happy to provide a setup wizard (?).

## Requirements

You will need some ether, but also it should be possible to run it locally (devnet).

## Ideas

* whisper integration
* alt clients (mobile?)

## Contact

Tips, ideas, etc: matias AT insaurral.de
